#BWL

[BWL](https://github.com/wajam/bwl) is a distributed working queue built on top [NRV](https://github.com/wajam/nrv), [SPNL](https://github.com/wajam/spnl) and [SNC](https://github.com/wajam/scn) frameworks.
The queue can be persisted on disk to survive clean or unexpected process shutdown. The queue can also be replicated to recover if a processing node is lost.
